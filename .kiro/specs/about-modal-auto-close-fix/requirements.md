# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The about modal in Hugselle is currently auto-closing immediately (within 1 second) after being opened, preventing users from reading the content. This issue is caused by event propagation where the click event that opens the modal is also triggering the modal's close handler. This fix will ensure the modal stays open until the user explicitly closes it via the close button, escape key, or clicking outside the modal content area.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click the "About" button and have the modal stay open so that I can read the information about Hugselle without it closing automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the "About" button THEN the about modal SHALL open and remain visible
2. WHEN the about modal is opened THEN it SHALL NOT close automatically within any timeframe
3. WHEN the about modal is displayed THEN the user SHALL be able to read all content without interruption

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to close the about modal only through intentional actions so that I have full control over when the modal dismisses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the close button (Ã—) THEN the modal SHALL close
2. WHEN the user presses the Escape key THEN the modal SHALL close
3. WHEN the user clicks on the backdrop (outside the modal content area) THEN the modal SHALL close
4. WHEN the user clicks inside the modal content area THEN the modal SHALL NOT close

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the modal to prevent accidental closures so that I don't lose access to information due to unintended clicks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modal is opening THEN click events from the triggering button SHALL NOT propagate to the modal's close handlers
2. WHEN the user clicks rapidly THEN the modal SHALL NOT close due to event timing issues
3. WHEN the modal is in the process of opening THEN backdrop click handlers SHALL NOT be active
4. IF a click event originated from opening the modal THEN that event SHALL NOT trigger the close handler
