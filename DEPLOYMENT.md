# Deployment Guide for Hugselle

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

2. **Run development server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. **Build for production:**
```bash
npm run build
```

## Testing the Quote Display

The quote display issue has been fixed with the following changes:

### What was fixed:
1. **Removed GSAP animation conflict** - The GSAP `from` animation was setting opacity to 0, causing the quote to disappear
2. **Added explicit opacity and transform** - Quote cards now have `opacity: 1 !important` and `transform: translateY(0) !important`
3. **Removed conflicting CSS animations** - The generic `.fade-in` class was removed from animations.css
4. **Added cleanup after animation** - After the fade-in animation completes, we explicitly set the styles to ensure visibility

### How to verify:
1. Start the dev server
2. Click "MAKE ME SMILE"
3. Select an identity (Boy/Girl/Animal)
4. Wait for the typing animation
5. **The quote should appear and STAY VISIBLE**
6. Click "Make Me Smile Again" to test multiple quotes
